# pyqt-mirror-graphicsview
Make horizontal symmetric image with QGraphicsView by using QImage "mirror" function

Hope someone finds this useful :)

Move the scroll bar back and forth and look how it works. You can zoom in and out to look whole image by Ctrl+Mouse Wheel Up / Down.

You only need PyQt5 to run this.
